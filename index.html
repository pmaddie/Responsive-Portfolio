      <p>I am a 25 year old Web Developer from Orlando, FL. I have been on my Web Developer journey for almost two
        years. I got my certification from UCF Coding Bootcamp in May 2019. It started as a hobby that I fell in love
        with as it allows me to be creative and technical simultaneously. I have a few other good hobbies I plan to grow
        into something that will allow me to generate income that way I can continue to strive for a lifestyle that
        gives me have more control and freedom! Other things I love would include fashion and sewing, exercising,
        personal development and socializing and travel, when possible.</p>
    

        <p>I was born and raised in Jacksonville, FL with my two sisters and little brother, me being the middle sister. I
        also have a niece who I am very close with and a handsome little nephew that I love just as much! I am extremely
        family oriented and one day I plan to have a family of my own. Until then, I will be building myself, adding to
        my resume stamping my passport and enjoying and creating my best life. </p>

        <p>Some fun facts about me are; my favorite mammal is a French bulldog and my favorite bird is a hawk; I used to
        play basketball and I am a huge LeBron James fan #JamesGang!; I am an empath and can be very sensitive at times;
        I was student council president and to this day, that's the last time I cared about politics; I've been through
        a lot, like most people in this world and that is another reason why I aim to be an extreme success. One of my
        favorite quotes is, "A ship is safe in harbor, but that is not what ships are made for."
